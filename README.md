# Zicky

Zicky helps you to track errors on your TDD session over smart contracts developed with Solidity, Also helps you to deploy them into the Ethereum network you want.

## Requirements

You will need to create in your local project a file ( we recommend to use an environment file and don't push it in your repo, as it'll have important information) with the follow keys:
`
ACCOUNT_MNEMONIC="Your twelve words go here"
INFURA_RINKEBY_ENDPOINT_V3=https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/<Some Key they infura people provides>


## For compile

* We use this to compile Smart contracts developed with Solc 0.8.9

## For Deploy

* We use Infura to deploy our contracts, create an account and add you endpoint into your env file. Please test this implementation under your responsability into a test network, like Rinkeby or Robertson, the main network will cost you real money.


## Using Examples within tests
